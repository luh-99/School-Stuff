# üöÄ Welcome to the School Bypass Project!
---
## Before we start, please read all the precautions below, and throughout creating this repository all the warnings I state in general.
---
> [!NOTE]
> Useful information for bypassing school rules (e.g., proxies, games, bookmarklets)
---
> [!TIP]
> If one of the URLs you have chosen is blocked keep trying as some of them will probably be blocked but that differs depending on the type/level of blocking system, the blocker itself, or just how smart your school is in general.
> 
> Also, don't be a stupid, **if you overshare the repo, obviously it is and will eventually be blocked.**
---
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Be careful when using some of the bypasses.
---
> [!WARNING]
> I am not responsible for any consequences you may face.
---
> [!CAUTION]
> If you have a question, use the issues tab, but use common sense,  I will not respond to dumb questions.

- I will most likely **NOT** be testing everything in this repository. I am doing making my findings available via this repository so that it is helpful for people in need of useful info about these things. However, if I do find something I am interested in testing, I will share all of my findings.
