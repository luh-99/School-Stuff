# üöÄ Welcome to the ###### Bypass Project!
> ###### = School. (Trying to make is less obvious)
---
## Before we start, please read all the precautions below. While creating this repository, I have included all the cautions I have said in general.
---
> [!NOTE]
> Useful information for bypassing rules (e.g., proxies, games, bookmarklets)
---
> [!TIP]
> Keep trying other methods if the URLs you have chosen are blocked when opening them in a browser. Some of them will likely be blocked. However, that varies depending on the type/level of the blocking system, the blocker itself, how smart your school is, how widespread the website is, and other factors including how smart you are when using them e.g: cloaking tab name, clearing history, and more.

> **Don't be an idiot while using the methods listed in this repository**
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Be careful when using some of the bypasses.
> **If you overshare the repo, it can and will eventually be blocked, of course, this varies on how long your district takes to block them.**

I am doing making my findings available via this repository so that it is helpful for people in need of useful info about these things. However, if I do find something I am interested in testing, I will share all of my findings.
  
- **Info Regarding the xploitspeed repo**:

You can always go to my [Profile](https://github.com/luh-99) on GitHub and click on the tab called "starred". From there, you can click on [School Stuff Repository](https://github.com/stars/luh-99/lists/school-stuff-repository) and go to the repository I have starred.
> I have not checked some of the starred repos to see whether they are trustworthy. This means that you need to use them with caution because they might contain things like malware, misinformation, and more.
