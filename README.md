## ⚡ Helpful Information

- I will **most likely NOT** be testing everything in this repository since I'm doing this for fun. However, if I find something interesting to test, I’ll be sure to share any findings.
  
- **Regarding the xploitspeed repo**:  
  **<DO> </NOT>** use the bypasses listed there as I haven't personally tested them. They might be outdated. Instead, check the **Issues** tab for more up-to-date bypasses.
